                 Hydropower (from Greek: ὕδωρ, "water"), also known as water power, 
                 is the use of falling or fast-running water to produce electricity or to 
                 power machines. This is achieved by converting the gravitational potential or 
                 kinetic energy of a water source to produce power. 
                 Hydropower is a method of sustainable energy production. 
                 Hydropower is now used principally for hydroelectric power generation, 
                 and is also applied as one half of an energy storage system known as 
                 pumped-storage hydroelectricity. Hydropower is an attractive alternative to 
                 fossil fuels as it does not directly produce carbon dioxide or other atmospheric 
                 pollutants and it provides a relatively consistent source of power. Nonetheless, 
                 it has economic, sociological, and environmental downsides and requires a 
                 sufficiently energetic source of water, such as a river or elevated lake. 
                 International institutions such as the World Bank view hydropower as a 
                 low-carbon means for economic development.
                Since ancient times, hydropower from watermills has been used as a renewable 
                energy source for irrigation and the operation of mechanical devices, such 
                as gristmills, sawmills, textile mills, trip hammers, dock cranes, domestic 
                lifts, and ore mills. A trompe, which produces compressed air from falling water, 
                is sometimes used to power other machinery at a distance.
