                    Some disadvantages of hydropower 
                    have been identified.
                     Dam failures can have catastrophic effects, 
                     including loss of life, property and pollution of land..

                    Dams and reservoirs can have major
                     negative impacts on river ecosystems 
                     such as preventing some animals traveling upstream,
                      cooling and de-oxygenating of water released 
                      downstream, and loss of nutrients due to settling 
                      of particulates. River sediment builds river deltas 
                      and dams prevent them from restoring what is lost from erosion.
                      Furthermore, studies found that the construction of 
                      dams and reservoirs can result in habitat loss for some aquatic species.

                    Large and deep dam and reservoir plants 
                    cover large areas of land which causes 
                    greenhouse gas emissions from underwater 
                    rotting vegetation. Furthermore, although at 
                    lower levels than other renewable energy sources,
                     it was found that hydropower produces methane gas which is
                      a greenhouse gas. This occurs when organic matters accumulate at
                       the bottom of the reservoir because of the deoxygenation of water 
                       which triggers anaerobic digestion.

                    People who live near a hydro plant site are displaced during construction or when reservoir banks become unstable. Another potential disadvantage 
                    is cultural or religious sites may block construction.

                    Wind power goes through predictable variation by season,
                     but is intermittent on a daily basis. Maximum wind generation 
                     has little relationship to peak daily electricity consumption,
                      the wind may peak at night when power isn't needed or be still 
                      during the day when electrical demand is highest. Occasionally 
                      weather patterns can result in low wind for days or weeks at a 
                      time, a hydroelectric reservoir capable of storing weeks of
                       output is useful to balance generation on the grid.
                        Peak wind power can be offset by minimum hydropower
                         and minimum wind can be offset with maximum hydropower.
                          In this way the easily regulated character of hydroelectricity 
                          is used to compensate for the intermittent nature of wind power. 
                          Conversely, in some cases wind power can be used to spare water 
                          for later use in dry seasons.
