                    Hydropower is a renewable source of energy.
                    The energy generated through hydropower relies on the water cycle, 
                    which is driven by the sun, making it renewable.
                </li><br>
                <li>Hydropower is fueled by water, making it a clean source of energy.
                    Hydroelectric power is a domestic source of energy,
                     allowing each state to produce its own energy 
                     without being reliant on international fuel sources.</li><br>
                <li>
                    Impoundment hydropower creates reservoirs that offer recreational 
                    opportunities such as fishing, swimming, and boating. 
                    Most hydropower installations are required to provide 
                    some public access to the reservoir to allow the public to 
                    take advantage of these opportunities. 
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Hydroelectric power is flexible. Some 
                    hydropower facilities can quickly go from
                     zero power to maximum output. Because hydropower
                      plants can generate power to the grid immediately, 
                      they provide essential backup power during major 
                      electricity outages or disruptions.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Hydropower provides benefits beyond
                     electricity generation by providing flood control,
                      irrigation support, and clean drinking water.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Hydropower is affordable. 
                    Hydropower provides low-cost e
                    lectricity and durability over 
                    time compared to other sources of energy. Construction costs can even be mitigated by using preexisting structures such as bridges, tunnels, and dams.
Hydropower complements other renewable energy sources.
 Technologies like pumped storage hydropower (PSH) store 
 energy to use in tandem with renewables such as wind and solar
  power when demand is high.

                    Hydropower is an established
                     industry in the United States, 
                     employing 66,500 people. And there 
                     are a growing number of jobs available 
                     in hydropower, including manufacturing, 
                     utilities, professional and business services,
                      construction, trade and transportation, energy systems,
                       water management, environmental science, welding, machinery, 
                       and other services.
