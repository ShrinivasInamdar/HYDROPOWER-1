                    Evidence suggests that the fundamentals of hydropower date 
                    to ancient Greek civilization. Other evidence indicates that the waterwheel 
                    independently emerged in China around the same period. Evidence of water wheels 
                    and watermills date to the ancient Near East in the 4th century BC.
                    : 14  Moreover, evidence indicates the use of hydropower using irrigation machines 
                    to ancient civilizations such as Sumer and Babylonia. Studies suggest that the water
                     wheel was the initial form of water power and it was driven by either humans or animals.

In the Roman Empire, water-powered mills were described by Vitruvius by the first century BC.
 The Barbegal mill, located in modern-day France, had 16 water wheels processing up to 28 tons of grain per day.
  Roman waterwheels were also used for sawing marble such as the Hierapolis sawmill of the late 3rd century AD.
   Such sawmills had a waterwheel that drove two crank-and-connecting rods to power two saws.
    It also appears in two 6th century Eastern Roman sawmills excavated at Ephesus and Gerasa respectively. 
    The crank and connecting rod mechanism of these Roman watermills converted the rotary motion of the waterwheel 
    into the linear movement of the saw blades.
